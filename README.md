# Paper 2 — Recording-quality variation and clinical speech inference in ALS

This repository contains the frozen computational analysis for Paper 2, which studies how recording-quality characteristics relate to clinical information and acoustic-model inference in remote ALS speech recordings.

## Status

Goals 1–3 are computationally complete and frozen.

The original immutable scientific-analysis freeze is:

- tag: `paper2-analysis-freeze-v1.0.0`
- commit: `55cba2083327aa71be5ea7771a3185daefa0c979`

Post-freeze repository changes are restricted to provenance, reproducibility, and documentation corrections. They do not redefine analysis populations, estimands, models, resampling, perturbation doses, feature definitions, or manuscript-facing numerical results.

## Scientific structure

- **Phase 0 — data freeze and audit:** construct canonical participant/recording ledgers, severity matching, Q registry, deterministic row selection, participant-grouped split manifests, and input hashes.
- **Goal 1 — information availability:** test whether the frozen recording-quality representation Q contains reproducible out-of-sample information about ALS diagnosis or contemporaneous bulbar function.
- **Goal 2 — consequence for acoustic inference:** test whether inference from a frozen clinical acoustic representation A changes when Q is added or when Q-predictable variation is removed from A.
- **Goal 3 — localization and controlled sensitivity:** localize natural Q–A coupling and test direct sensitivity of Q, A, and frozen clinical predictions to prespecified same-source acquisition perturbations.

The interpretation boundary is deliberately conservative. Natural-data associations do not establish technical cause, confounding, artifact, or shortcut learning. Controlled perturbations support direct sensitivity to the imposed transformation; they do not prove that the same transformation generated an observational clinical association.

## Core validation contract

Participant is the independent unit for train/test splitting, permutation, and bootstrap resampling. No held-out participant contributes to training-fold preprocessing, tuning, QCHAN reference construction, residualization, or calibration.

Primary repeated internal validation uses 5 outer folds × 10 repeats with participant grouping and base seed `20260825`. Participant-level bootstrap confidence intervals use 2,000 replicates. Goal 1 formal permutation inference uses 1,000 participant-level permutations per task.

## Authoritative computational lineage

The repository intentionally retains historical notebook variants for auditability. Do not infer authority from filename order alone. The final lineage and supersession map are in [`docs/ANALYSIS_LINEAGE.md`](docs/ANALYSIS_LINEAGE.md), and the notebook-oriented execution map is in [`notebooks/README.md`](notebooks/README.md).

A post-freeze provenance correction adds `notebooks/35_goal3_controlled_perturbation_PRIMARY_FINAL_v1_1_1.ipynb`. This is the final Stage-E completion patch used to create the retained prediction-unavailability audit. Relative to v1.1.0, it fixes one support-summary reduction and adds explicit baseline-gated prediction-unavailability tables; it does not rerun or change the 14,792 waveform measurements, frozen perturbation doses, model states, prediction rules, or inferential estimands.

## Data and external dependencies

Raw audio, participant-level clinical data, adjudication files, and other restricted source data are not committed to this repository. Generated `outputs/` are also private by default. The public repository therefore supports code inspection and reconstruction by authorized users with the governed inputs; it is not a public raw-data release.

Goal 3 reuses the Paper-1 measurement implementation pinned at commit:

`cb31fb6886df1b2b2fedba4ffbbf8624bd56d7e8`

See [`docs/RUNTIME_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/RUNTIME_PROVENANCE.md) for the actual recorded Stage-E execution environment and the documented Python-version compatibility divergence.

## Getting started

Create the general reconstruction environment and run the public, data-free
validation suite:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate paper2-leakage
python -m pytest
```

For the governed frozen output archive, run:

```bash
python tools/verify_frozen_outputs.py /path/to/outputs.zip
```

See [`docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) for the three distinct
validation levels, their prerequisites, and the limits of what each establishes.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `configs/` | Frozen analysis configuration and expected cohort counts |
| `data/` | Governed-input layout placeholders; no participant data are public |
| `docs/` | Lineage, runtime provenance, frozen-output audit, and reproduction guide |
| `notebooks/` | Authoritative analyses plus explicitly retained historical variants |
| `src/paper2/` | Package namespace for reusable, scientifically validated code |
| `tests/` | Fast structural and verifier unit tests that require no governed data |
| `tools/` | Standalone frozen-output verification utility |

## Release integrity

The scientific freeze tag must remain immutable. Cleanup and documentation
commits after the freeze do not alter notebook logic, model definitions,
analysis populations, estimands, resampling, perturbation doses, or frozen
numerical results. GitHub Actions checks Python 3.11 and 3.12 for source
compilation, notebook JSON integrity, YAML validity, verifier behavior, and
whitespace errors.

## Environment

`environment.yml` is the project reconstruction environment, not a bit-for-bit historical lockfile. The exact critical Stage-E package versions recorded in the frozen outputs are listed in `requirements-goal3-stageE-historical-critical.txt`. A supported reconstruction environment for the pinned Paper-1 implementation is provided in `environment-goal3-supported.yml`.

The full frozen-output audit record is in [`docs/FROZEN_OUTPUT_AUDIT.md`](docs/FROZEN_OUTPUT_AUDIT.md). A standard-library verifier for an extracted or zipped frozen output package is provided at `tools/verify_frozen_outputs.py`.
